In order to use offline cache, .manifest files need to be served with a special mime type.

Add the following line to your Apache configuration file:

AddType text/cache-manifest .manifest

Dear developer, in order to be able to debug offline caching issues correctly, you should enable the "expires" module and set on your vhost conf file:

ExpiresActive On
ExpiresDefault "access"
